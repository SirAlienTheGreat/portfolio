                <h3>Rust (Programming Language)</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is my (as well as many other peoples') favorite programming language,thanks to its compile-time memory-safety guarantees, zero-cost-abstractions,and almost no performance overhead. I've been programming in rust since 2021,and it has become my default programming language</p>

                <p>Some of the projects I've done in Rust are: <a href="https://github.com/SirAlienTheGreat/discord-gdpr-grapher">Discord GDPR data grapher</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SirAlienTheGreat/rust-game">rust-game</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/SirAlienTheGreat/oped-game-v2">self-hosted AMQ clone</a></p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Python was the first language I became advanced in (previously, I had only learned the basics of JavaScript). It's a great language because of its many libraries and ease of writing, but for tasks where performance is necessary, it nature as an interpreted language leaves a bit to be desired</p>

                <p>A project I did in Python is this <a href="https://github.com/SirAlienTheGreat/MAL-anime-per-month">MAL data grapher</a></p>

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is such a ubiquitous language that it's almost impossible NOT to learn. While it has been increasingly used for larger standalone projects (something it was never designed to do), it still works well at its original job: making website elements more interactive. However, it is important to be aware of how it can be a security risk, which is why almost every page on this website works with no JavaScript</p>

                <p>All of the projects I did in JavaScript were for classes which didn't allow publishing of projects</p>

                <h3>C++</h3>
                <p>My college Computer Science classes are taught in C++, so I learned all about pointers and the data structures that can be made from them in C++. C++ is an extremely fun language because of its "freedom-first" approach that allows developers to play with pointers and memory in a way that most other languages would never allow, leading to amazing (and fun) microprograms. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/briefing-room/2024/02/26/press-release-technical-report/">the white house</a> has advised against languages like C++ because their freedom often results in memory bugs that lead to serious vulnerabilities, challenging debugging, and unreproducible crashes</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>I only know Java up to the AP Computer Science level, because that class is taught in Java. This language was very revolutionary for its time, with the introduction of object-oriented programming and its middle ground between interpreted and compiled languages.</p>

                <h3>Linux</h3>
                <p>I've been using Linux as my daily driver PC since 2020, so I've become an expert in the Linux CLI. This has proved to be very useful for all kinds of system administration tasks, including setting up the server that you got this website from just now!</p>

                <p>I maintained the server for my high school's <a href="https://frhs.tech/">Computer Science Honor Society</a> for over 2 years, and am still on call for any issues that the new team can't overcome themselves. I'm also maintaining the Debian server that runs this website.</p>
